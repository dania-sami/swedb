# Swedbank Analyst Lab

This repository contains three small analytical mini projects designed to showcase the skills relevant for the Swedbank Analyst Trainee Program.

The projects are structured into three tracks that mirror key areas of the program.

## Structure

1. data-analytics-track
   Focused on customer analytics, data exploration and a simple predictive model.

2. risk-credit-analytics-track
   Focused on a basic credit risk scorecard style model and risk thinking.

3. treasury-markets-track
   Focused on a simple yield curve and interest rate scenario style analysis.

Each folder contains:
- A short written summary of the idea and approach.
- A small example dataset.
- A Python script showing how the data could be analysed.

All projects are intentionally light weight and illustrative so they are quick to review but still show how you think and work with data, models and insights.
