# Data Analytics Track – Customer Analytics Mini Project

Idea:
Use a small synthetic customer dataset to explore patterns in age, tenure, products owned and average balance, and build a very simple churn prediction model.

Example steps:
1. Load the data and look at basic statistics.
2. Visualise relationships, for example between tenure, products owned and churn.
3. Train a simple classification model in Python to predict churn, such as logistic regression or a decision tree.
4. Interpret which features seem most important and turn the results into a short insight summary.
