# Risk and Credit Analytics Track – Simple Credit Scorecard Mini Project

Idea:
Use a small synthetic credit dataset to build a very simple probability of default model.

Example steps:
1. Explore how income, debt levels, past late payments and relationship length relate to default.
2. Train a basic logistic regression or tree based model to predict default.
3. Translate the model result into a simple scorecard logic: higher risk versus lower risk profiles.
4. Summarise how such a model could support credit decisions and portfolio monitoring.
