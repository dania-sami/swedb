# Treasury and Markets Track – Yield Curve and Scenario Mini Project

Idea:
Use a small synthetic yield curve dataset to explore how interest rates across maturities move in a base case and a simple stress scenario.

Example steps:
1. Plot the base yield curve versus a stressed yield curve.
2. Comment on how higher rates could affect funding costs and interest income.
3. Outline how this type of scenario thinking links to asset liability management and risk aggregation.
