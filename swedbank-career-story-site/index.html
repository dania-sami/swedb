        <h2>From THS Armada at KTH to Swedbank</h2>
        <div class="grid two">
          <div>
            <p>
              My first real contact with Swedbank was at the THS Armada career fair at KTH.
              I was part of the fair organisation and worked closely with the event team during the day.
              This gave me a different perspective on the companies that were present, since I could see
              both the preparation behind the stands and the conversations that happened with students.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the fair I visited the Swedbank stand and talked with employees about how the bank works with
              risk, data and analytics. We discussed how the bank thinks about customers, lending and long term value,
              and how analysts support these decisions with models and insight.
              That short conversation stayed with me.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the fair I decided to look deeper into Swedbank, the analyst work and the trainee program.
              The combination of responsibility, structured analysis and impact on real customers is exactly the kind of environment
              where I want to grow.

            <ul>
              <li>Swedbank has a clear focus on long term relationships with customers.</li>
              <li>Data and analytics are central in daily decisions.</li>
              <li>The culture felt open and approachable during every conversation.</li>
              <li>I could clearly see myself contributing in this environment.</li>

            <h3>Strong analytical environment</h3>
            <p>
              The Analyst Trainee Program combines risk, treasury, data and business steering.
              This fits perfectly with my background in Computer Engineering and my current studies at KTH,
              where I work with problem solving, modelling and structured thinking every day.
            </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Real responsibility early</h3>
            <p>
              I enjoy taking ownership and working with clear accountability for results.
              Working at KTH alongside my studies has trained me to deliver under time pressure and to manage several
              responsibilities at the same time.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Long term growth</h3>
            <p>
              I am looking for a place where I can grow for many years.
              The trainee program with planned rotations and a base unit fits exactly with how I want to develop as
              an analyst in the financial sector.

          To show how I think and work with data, I created three small mini projects.
          Each project is simple on purpose, easy to review and focused on clear logic and insight.

              A small customer dataset, basic exploration and a simple model that predicts churn.
              The goal is to show how I connect data patterns to practical decisions about customer retention.

              An illustrative credit dataset with income, debt and payment history,
              and a simple model that estimates probability of default.
              The focus is on structured risk logic and clear communication.
